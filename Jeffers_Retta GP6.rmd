Notes: 
  - You do not have to put all of your team members' code into a single file. I have included all 5 analyses just for your information. You only need the code for your analysis.
  - The tasks include both coding and written interpretation. 
  - Please knit to word document -- it will make it easier to combine your results with your team members in to the single manuscript (submitted in GP4).

## Setup

### Load packages

Add whatever additional packages you need for your analysis

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
### EDIT!!!

### We use the code chunk option "include=FALSE" because we don't need to print this information

### Global knitr options
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

### Load packages/libraries that we will need
library(tidyverse)
library(viridis)       # Better plot colors
library(ggpubr)        # Fancy plots
library(skimr)         # sample summary table
library(GGally)        # sample summary viz
#  edit! Add whatever additional packages you need here (if you haven't loaded them, RMarkdown should alert you when you go to "knit" the RMarkdown to a report)
```


### Custom ggplot theme

So that we don't need to add this code to all ggplots individually. Feel free to use or not use, and to modify however you wish.

```{r theme}
### DON'T EDIT CODE IN THIS CHUNK

theme_custom <- theme_bw() +
  
  # if we have a plot title or subtitle, let's center it
  theme (
    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),
    plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5)
  ) 
theme_set(theme_custom)

### We'll make the viridis color scale our default plotting color palette
scale_colour_continuous <- function(...) {
  scale_colour_viridis_c(...)
}
scale_fill_continuous <- function(...) {
  scale_fill_viridis_c(...)
}
scale_colour_discrete <- function(...) {
  scale_colour_viridis_d(..., begin = 0, end = 0.9)
}
scale_fill_discrete <- function(...) {
  scale_fill_viridis_d(..., begin = 0, end = 0.9)
}
```


### Setwd fix (if needed)

If you are having trouble loading the exprs_tidy file below, manually override the working directory. To do this
  1. In the menu bar, click: Session > Set Working Directory > To Source File Location
  2. Copy the line of code in the console, and paste it into the code chunk below
  
```{r fix_setwd}
### EDIT if necessary

```


### FYI: how I got the data

```{r get_data, eval=FALSE}
### Get list of available datasets
### https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/3.3/bioc/vignettes/TCGAbiolinks/inst/doc/tcgaBiolinks.html#harmonized-data-1
View(getGDCprojects())

### Datasets to use for group project (I picked the ones with smallest sample size and no sex bias)
projects <- c(
  "TCGA-ACC",
  "TCGA-CHOL", 
  "TCGA-DLBC", 
  "TCGA-KICH", 
  "TCGA-MESO", 
  "TCGA-UVM"
)

phenoList <-  vector(mode = "list", length = length(projects))
names(phenoList) <- projects
exprsList <-  vector(mode = "list", length = length(projects))
names(exprsList) <- projects
for (i in projects) { 
  ### Get data (in summarized experiment ["se"]  format)
  query <- GDCquery(
    project = i, 
    data.category = "Transcriptome Profiling", 
    data.type = "Gene Expression Quantification", 
    workflow.type = "HTSeq - FPKM"
  )
  GDCdownload(query)
  se <- GDCprepare(query)
  
  ### Extract phenoData and remove columns that either are all different or all consistent
  pheno_full <- as.data.frame(colData(se))
  pheno <- janitor::remove_constant(pheno_full)
  
  ### Extract exprs matrix and remove lowly expressed
  exprs_full <- assay(se)
  keep <- rowSums(exprs_full > 1) >= 10
  exprs <- exprs_full[keep, ]

  ### Shorten the sample id
  rownames(pheno) <- abbreviate(gsub("TCGA-OR-", "", rownames(pheno)), method = "both")
  pheno$id <- rownames(pheno)
  colnames(exprs) <- abbreviate(gsub("TCGA-OR-", "", colnames(exprs)), method = "both")
  
  ### Remove extra columns (not groups)
  pheno$sample <- pheno$id
  pheno$id <- NULL
  remove_cols <- c(
    "patient", "updated_datetime", "updated_datetime.x", "updated_datetime.y", 
    "barcode", "diagnosis_id", "demographic_id", "exposure_id", "bcr_patient_barcode", 
    "morphology", "treatments", 
    "days_to_birth", "days_to_last_follow_up", "days_to_death",
    "year_of_birth", "year_of_diagnosis", "year_of_death"
  )
  pheno <- pheno[ , !(colnames(pheno) %in% remove_cols)]
  pheno <- pheno[ , !(colnames(pheno) %in% colnames(pheno)[grep("_CHOL_del|_CHOL_amp|subtype_", colnames(pheno))])]

  ### Save
  saveRDS(exprs, paste0(i, "_exprs.rds"))
  saveRDS(pheno, paste0(i, "_pheno.rds"))
  
  ### Add to list
  exprsList[[i]]  <- exprs
  phenoList[[i]] <- pheno
  
  ### Clean up
  rm(exprs)
  rm(exprs_full)
  rm(pheno)
  rm(pheno_full)
  rm(keep)
}

### Save
saveRDS(exprsList, "all_exprs.rds")
saveRDS(phenoList, "all_pheno.rds")

### Look at
sapply(exprsList, dim)
sapply(phenoList, dim)
sapply(phenoList, names)

### Write out names
rbind(
  paste("ACC:", toString(sort(names(phenoList$`TCGA-ACC`)))),
  paste("CHOL:", toString(sort(names(phenoList$`TCGA-CHOL`)))),
  paste("DLBC:", toString(sort(names(phenoList$`TCGA-DLBC`)))),
  paste("KICH:", toString(sort(names(phenoList$`TCGA-KICH`)))),
  paste("MESO:", toString(sort(names(phenoList$`TCGA-MESO`)))),
  paste("UVM:", toString(sort(names(phenoList$`TCGA-UVM`))))
) %>%
  writeLines("sample_variables.txt")
```


## Pre-process data 

Your entire team should use the same code for this section!

### Load your dataset

```{r load_data}
### EDIT: You need to insert your dataset file names in the quotes below

exprs <- readRDS("~/R/TCGA-UVM_exprs.rds")
pheno <- readRDS("~/R/TCGA-UVM_pheno.rds")
```

### Pick your group (variable of interest)

This should be a variable that is categorical with at least 2 categories and at least 3 samples in each category Use colnames(pheno) to find out what variable options you have. You can use one of the descriptive summary functions (from AE3) to determine how many categories there are for each group, and how many samples there are for each category.

```{r select_group}
### EDIT!! Copy your variable of interest into a new column called "group". This will help generalize/simplify your project's code
pheno$group <- pheno$age_at_index # EDIT: insert your variable's column name here

### I grouped ages
pheno$group <- ifelse(
  pheno$age_at_index < 55, "<55", ifelse(
    pheno$age_at_index > 70, ">70", "55-70"
  )
)
```

### Filter samples

Check for samples with missing data for your "group"

```{r filter_samples_check}
### Don't edit

### You can check this using the following (many other ways to check too)
### Make sure no "blanks" either -- 
### sometimes missing data isn't converted to an NA but instead is just blank
summary(as.factor(pheno$group)) # look for blanks, no data, etc. categories
table(is.na(pheno$group))
```

Remove samples with missing data (or no data; i.e. "not reported") for your "group". First from phenoData

(Here, there weren't any)

```{r filter_samples_remove}
### Don't edit

### Remove NAs
pheno <- pheno[!is.na(pheno$group), ]

### Remove blanks
pheno <- pheno[!(pheno$group == ""), ]

### Remove "not reported"
pheno <- pheno[!(pheno$group == "not reported"), ]
```

And also remove them from exprsData

```{r}
### Don't edit

exprs <- exprs[ , which(colnames(exprs) %in% rownames(pheno))]
```

### Filter genes with low expression

Here we'll require FPKM > 5 in at least 25 samples (it will help reduce computational time)

```{r filter_genes}
### Don't edit

### Filter
exprs <- exprs[rowSums(exprs > 5) > 25, ]
```

### Finalize data

Match order of samples in both pheno (rownames) and exprs (colnames) datasets

```{r matrices}
### Don't edit

### Match order of samples in both matrices
table(colnames(exprs) == rownames(pheno)) # check
pheno <- pheno[match(colnames(exprs), rownames(pheno)), ] # fixes if needed
table(colnames(exprs) == rownames(pheno)) # check
```

###Convert expression matrix to tidy, so that we also have a tidy version of the data in case we need it.

```{r tidy}
### Don't edit

### Create tibble with expression and pheno data
tidy <- exprs %>% 
  
  # Convert expression matrix to tidy tibble
  as_tibble(rownames = "gene") %>%
  gather("sample", "fpkm", -gene)  %>%

  # Add phenoData
  inner_join(pheno, by = "sample")
```

### Team member 2: Distribution
```{r}
### a. Generate histogram, frequency plot, density plot, and density ridge plot of expression vaues for each category in your group of interest

###cALCULATE LOG2(FPKM)
tidy$logFPKM <-log2(tidy$fpkm + 0.00001) #addsmall value to prevent the "-Inf" caused by log2(0)

###Histogram
tidy %>% 
  ggplot(aes (x= logFPKM, color = group, fill = group))+
  geom_histogram(alpha =0.2)

ggsave ("histogram.png")

###Frequency plot
tidy %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = logFPKM, color = group, fill = group))+
  geom_freqpoly()
  
ggsave("freqplot.png")
###density plot
tidy%>%
  ggplot(aes(x = logFPKM, color = group, fill = group))+
  geom_density(alpha = 0.2)

ggsave("density.png")
  
tidy %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = logFPKM,  y = group, color = group, fill = group)) +
  ggridges::geom_density_ridges(alpha = 0.2, show.legend = FALSE) +

  # Add mean as line
  ggpubr::stat_central_tendency(
    type = "mean", 
    geom = "line",
    show.legend = FALSE
  ) +

  # Add median as triange at bottom
  ggpubr::stat_central_tendency(
    type = "median", 
    geom = "point", size = 5, shape = 17, 
    show.legend = FALSE
  ) 

ggsave("ridges_means_medians.png")

```

### b. Decide which best illustrates your distributions


### c. Generate a final distribution figure to include in the manuscript

### d. Indicate the mean and median in the figure, for each cagtegory in your group of interest
```{r dist_mean}

### Add mean and median to our ridges plot
```

### e. Determine distribution shapes (skewedness, kurtosis)

## Session info

```{r sessioninfo}
sessionInfo()
